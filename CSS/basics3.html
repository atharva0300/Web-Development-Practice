    <! Division ( Divs ) : Divs are similar to table cells, in that they contain table content such as text images or media objects >
    <! the key difference is that, divs offer a mich higher degree of customization and positioning >
    <! this includes things like rounded corners, transparency, layering and complete flexibility of the positioning down the pixel >

    <div id="div1" class="underline">This is a line of text in the div tag</div>
    <! div1 is the id, a unique id >
    <! divs are called layout elements, because they contain contents like graphics , media elements, that make our webpages.>
    <! each div requires its unique set of attributes >
    <! Example - Position attribute : 2 divs can't be located on the same page side.>
    <! because of that, we use the position attribute to give a unique position to hte div >
